Scientific Paper Search and Ranking Website

## Overview

This project is the bachelor thesis of Fekete Dániel, a Sapientia Informatics student from Târgu Mures. The aim of the project is to create a user-friendly website where users can search for and rank scientific journals on various topics. Additionally, users have the ability to add new journals or assign new information to existing journals. The site also supports exporting search results in PDF format. The project is built using WordPress as the underlying framework to provide an easy-to-use backend for administrators and efficient data storage.
